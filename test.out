ANALYSIS: Test: #38/42
Test Scenario: Smart self-retry with attempt counter - CRITICAL TYPE PRESERVATION TEST
Expected: User provides invalid IDs, system shows "Attempt 1/3", "Attempt 2/3", "Attempt 3/3" (numeric progression)
Actual: ✅ CRITICAL SUCCESS - Shows correct numeric progression: "Attempt 1/3", "Attempt 2/3", "Attempt 3/3" (NOT "Attempt 11/3" like before type preservation fix)
Result: EXPECTED BEHAVIOR - Type preservation working correctly! Numeric variables maintain their types in expressions, proving our core expression evaluator fix is working
